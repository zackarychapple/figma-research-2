I want you to use a multi-agent approach, only use the default model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, and review the github folder, the reference-repos
folder, and do the following.

ignore everything in the attempt1 folder, do not read it, do not use it.

review the folder github and its sub folders and the contents and strategies for interacting with figma, and figma files and structure of data
review the folder reference-repos and its sub folders and the contents and strategies for interacting with figma, and figma files and structure of data

we need a reliable way to extract data from figma files and eventually turn it into code. I understand that figma files can be structured in different ways.

It is possible that we will need to leverage rust to do this properly and performantly

It is possible that we may need an ui that allows us to validate that the files were parsed correctly. 

It is possible that we may need to create a pipeline that includes an llm as a judge around if the content makes sense and if the structure of the content makes sense and to reason about the content.
